# Predicting-deflection-in-beam

The dataset created is added in the repository named as testcases4.csv which contains four columns x,a,y(deflection) and m1 = [x-a]. The meanings of these parameters and formulas used for the creation of datasets are mentioned in the DLPS_presentation.

Two approaches were used in order to train the model to predict deflection in the beams whose separate codes are given and explained in the presentation. Clearly, we've got better accuracy for our first approach i.e. Neural Networks.
